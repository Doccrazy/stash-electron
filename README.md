[![Lint/Test](https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron/actions/workflows/lint.yml) [![Build/release](https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Stash is a graphical password and secret storage and management tool designed for collaboration, security and ease-of-use.

It features full end-to-end encryption and does not require a server component, giving you full control over who is able to access your secrets.

Stash will always be **fully open-source** without any subscriptions, "premium" features or hidden gotchas. You are free to use Stash in any environment, including commercially, as long as you respect the [GPL license](https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Features

- Desktop application for Windows/Linux/Mac
- Asymmetric end-to-end encryption using RSA and AES256
- No server component required, secrets are stored and versioned by a simple git repository
- Stores login credentials or any type of secret files
- Fully featured user and access rights management
- Git-based data integrity protection and audit log
- Batteries included: No external tools, complex setup or command line usage required

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases page: [ ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Doccrazy/stash-electron) ](https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron/releases).

Due to the shutdown of Bintray, the Debian repository is no longer available. For Debian/Ubuntu, please download and install the .deb file directly or use the AppImage package.

As of 05/2021, AUR packages for Arch Linux are no longer available. Please use the AppImage download instead, which also supports automatic updates.

Development snapshots are available for all platforms from the snapshots repository: [ ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Doccrazy/stash-electron-snapshots?include_prereleases) ](https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron-snapshots/releases)

## Getting started

Stash requires a git repository to store its data. It is highly recommended to use a private, password-protected repository. All data is encrypted, the server owner will never get access to your secrets. Some free choices:

- [Bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org), free private repository for up to 5 users
- [Perforce Helix TeamHub](https://www.perforce.com/git-hosting), free private repository for up to 5 users
- [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register-pane), unlimited free private repositories
- Self-hosted: Run `git init --bare` on any accessible server

After creating the git repo, run Stash and navigate to the **Settings** page.

1. Clone your repository to an empty folder by clicking _Add_, then selecting the _Clone_ option.
2. Configure your private key by clicking the highlighted _Account status_ icon in the top right corner. You may either load an existing private key (e.g. SSH key, all formats incl. Putty supported), or generate a new key by clicking the button. You should always **password-protect** your private key.  
   :warning: Your private key is your access pass to your secrets. If you lose your key, you lose access to all your secrets, and there is no way of recovery. So **keep your key safe and secure, back it up and never share it with anyone!**
3. Add yourself to the list of known users on the **Users** page (add user -> use my key). All users and public keys must be known to Stash. Do not forget to **save your changes**.
4. Open the **Browser** page and initialize the repository permissions by authorizing yourself on the root folder: Right-click on the root folder, select _Permissions_, toggle your user and confirm with _Save_.
5. Your repository is now fully set up and ready for you to start creating folders and secrets!
6. Every change you make automatically creates a git commit. Use the flashing icon in the top right to **push/share your changes**.

## Development

Stash is a Node.js/React application running on [Electron](https://electronjs.org). To start development, you will need a recent Node.js/npm installation.

### Install

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Doccrazy/stash-electron.git stash-electron
```

And then install dependencies with npm.

```bash
cd stash-electron
npm install
```

### Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [hot-module-replacement](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Package

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,

```bash
npm run package all
```

### Release

Versioning is done automatically based on git tags and commits. You should never have to set the version in `package.json` manually. Every git commit on master publishes a snapshot release to Github.

To create a final release, follow these steps to ensure the release is published correctly:

1. Follow the guidelines of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to determine a version number.
2. Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` is complete, then update the release date and version and push the changes.
3. Wait for the Travis build to complete and publish a snapshot.
4. Perform any necessary tests on the snapshot version.
5. Draft a new Github release, using `vx.y.z` as the tag name and `x.y.z` as the release name.
6. After Travis has uploaded the files, copy the notes from `CHANGELOG.md` and publish the release.
